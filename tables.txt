What can students do?

They can view (select their grades). That is done by selecting a lecture that is assigned to them. That is done by viewing the lectures list that is on their user. Lectures list per user is visible.

Lectures list per user -> Lectures list -> Selecting a lecture -> Viewing their grades

Simplified:
Since user is a part of a group, certain lectures will be assigned to certain groups.

Even more simplified:

Each lecture has a groupID

That gives us:

Lectures list per group -> Selecting a lecture by viewing user's group -> Viewing that user's grade

WHBD:

Generate a lectures list per group's ID
Once you select a lecture, it will have to show your current grades and their types per studentID and lectureID.

What we need:

lectureID to have a groupID in order for us to see what lectures are assigned to a certain group.
